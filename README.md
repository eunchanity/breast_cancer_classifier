# Breast Cancer Classifier

A deployed app using Streamlit and Heroku that determines whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant based on user input of cell characteristics.

The app was created as part of my <a href="https://github.com/eunchanity/davids_repo/tree/master/projects/project3_breastcancer" target="_blank">project</a> that used logistic regression to built a classification model.

The deployed app can be found here: <a href="https://breast-cancer-tumor-classifer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://breast-cancer-tumor-classifer.herokuapp.com/</a>
